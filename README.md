# Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-Machine-Learning-Models
The real-time anomaly intrusion detection system (IDS) utilizes machine learning models to detect malicious activities that conventional firewalls may miss. It focuses on identifying attacks by analyzing patterns and irregularities compared to normal behavior, making it effective in detecting new and unknown threats.
