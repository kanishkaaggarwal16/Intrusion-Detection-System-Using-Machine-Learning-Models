# Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-Machine-Learning-Models
The real-time anomaly intrusion detection system (IDS) utilizes machine learning models to detect malicious activities that conventional firewalls may miss. It focuses on identifying attacks by analyzing patterns and irregularities compared to normal behavior, making it effective in detecting new and unknown threats. 

Among the tested machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the highest accuracy in detecting anomalies. However, it is important to note that SVM exhibited slower training and testing times compared to other algorithms.

In conclusion, the real-time anomaly intrusion detection system utilizing machine learning models offers improved detection capabilities for identifying malicious activities.
